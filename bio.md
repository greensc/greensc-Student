Hi, my name is Scott Green. I am currently in New Mexico, but I am a California native. I am a father of six and an Air Force veteran. I have five degrees in Graphic Design, Animation, 3D Computer Animation, Avionics, and Information Technology and two certificates in Multimedia and Screenwriting. My hobbies include: gold mining, running, hiking, writing stories, reading sci-fi, watching comedy and sci-fi movies, and family. I currently work for the USGS (United States Geological Survey) as a Hydrologic Technician, measuring the water in the streams and rivers in the southern half of New Mexico. I would like to transfer to an office in California to be closer to family and friends and eventually transition into a Computer Science/Programming position.

programming background
======================

My first exposure to programming was in 1987. It was a Basic programming class using TRS-80 computers. Recently, I have taken classes in Java, Javascript, Microsoft App Programming, HTML, SQL, and C++. My future goal is to obtain a creative position at a game, animation, or technology company like Electronic Arts, Pixar, Google, or YouTube. If that falls through, I would like to work for a defense contractor or government agency like NASA or the NSA.
